# How has the share of vulnerable employment among women evolved relative to that of men in Cuba between 1991 and 2023?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI), this study examines the evolution of vulnerable employment in Cuba between 1991 and 2023. The analysis compares two key indicators: vulnerable employment, female (% of female employment) and vulnerable employment, male (% of male employment). Over this thirty-two-year period, both indicators increased moderately from the mid-1990s to 2010 and then rose more sharply from 2010 onward. However, vulnerable employment among men consistently remained higher than among women throughout the entire period, and the gap between the two widened over time. These trends highlight a persistent gender disparity in the nature of employment in Cuba — one that has deepened despite overall increases in vulnerable employment for both sexes, reflecting structural labor market challenges and unequal exposure to informal and insecure work conditions.

## 1. Question

How has the share of vulnerable employment among women evolved relative to that of men in Cuba between 1991 and 2023?

- **Female vulnerable employment proxy**: Vulnerable employment, female (% of female employment)
- **Male vulnerable employment proxy**: Vulnerable employment, male (% of male employment)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Vulnerable employment, female (% of female employment)
  - Vulnerable employment, male (% of male employment)
- **Coverage**: Cuba, 1991–2023
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Cuba and selected the two vulnerable employment indicators.
2. **Extracted relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, and Value.
3. Pivoted the dataset to enable side-by-side chronological comparison of male and female vulnerable employment shares.
4. Produced a dual-line time series plot to visualize trends, gaps, and the rate of change between male and female vulnerable employment.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Vulnerable employment, female (% of female employment)**: Increased moderately from 1996 to 2010, followed by a sharper rise from 2010 to 2023, reflecting growing exposure of women to informal and unstable forms of work.
- **Vulnerable employment, male (% of male employment)**: Displayed a similar trajectory but remained consistently higher than female levels throughout, with a widening gap in later years.
- **Comparison**: Both male and female vulnerable employment increased significantly over time, particularly after 2010. However, the persistent and expanding gender gap indicates that men are disproportionately represented in vulnerable forms of work, and that this imbalance has intensified even as overall rates have risen.

## 5. Interpretation

- The sustained increase in vulnerable employment for both genders suggests structural weaknesses in Cuba’s labor market, including limited access to formal job opportunities and persistent informality.
- The consistently higher rates among men may reflect gendered occupational structures, with male workers concentrated in sectors more prone to informality or instability.
- The widening gender gap points to diverging labor market experiences and potentially unequal access to secure, protected employment for women versus men.
- These findings highlight the importance of gender-sensitive employment policies aimed at reducing vulnerability while expanding formal work opportunities across sectors.

## 6. Limitations

- National aggregates may mask sectoral and regional disparities in labor conditions.
- WDI data are modeled ILO estimates and may carry uncertainty, particularly for earlier years.
- The analysis is descriptive and does not isolate causal drivers such as policy reforms, labor migration, or shifts in economic structure.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Disaggregate data by sector to examine gender differences in vulnerable employment across industries.
- Analyze correlations between vulnerable employment and macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, labor productivity, and social protection coverage.
- Compare Cuba’s gender gap in vulnerable employment with those of other Caribbean or Latin American countries to contextualize its labor market dynamics.
- Conduct time-series decomposition to identify structural versus cyclical drivers of rising vulnerable employment and the widening gender gap.
